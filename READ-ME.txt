Supported operating systems:
	GNU/Linux


Usage:
	passgen <password_length> <dictionary_id> [extra_options]

Examples:

		passgen 16 2

	Generate a random password with a minimum length of 16 and a maximum length of 32:
		passgen 16-32 2

	Generate a random password with a length of 16 from a user defined dictionary:
		passgen 16 0 < ~/.passgen/dicts/wordlist.txt

		Note: Input data must be UTF-8 encoded and each character/word must be separated by a new line.
